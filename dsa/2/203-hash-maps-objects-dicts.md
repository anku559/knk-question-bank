### Count individual characters

* *Write an algorithm that counts each and every character in a given string (number of times that character is repeating)?*

```jsx
// AAABBCCCCC##**
// {'*': 2, 'C': 5, '#': 2, 'B': 2, 'A': 3}
```

### Count word frequency

* *Write an algorithm that counts the number of times each word appears in a sentence?*

### Check anagrams

* *Write an algorithm to check if two strings are anagrams of each other (i.e., they contain the same characters in the same frequency, regardless of order)?*

### Count vowels and constants

* *Write an algorithm that counts each vowel and constants occurrence in a given string (number of times that vowel and constants is repeating)?*

### First non-repeating character

* *Write an algorithm that finds the first non-repeating character in a given string and returns it. If all characters repeat, return None?*

### Find K-th Non-Repeating Character

* *Write an algorithm that finds the K-th non-repeating character in a given string. If fewer than K non-repeating characters exist, return None?*

### Group anagrams

* *Given a list of words, write an algorithm to group all the anagrams together and return them as a list of lists.*

### Count list elements

* *Write an algorithm that counts how many times each element appears in a list of integers.*

### Most frequent element

* *Write an algorithm that finds the most frequent element in a given list. If there are multiple elements with the same highest frequency, return any one of them.*

### Check unique characters

* *Write an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters using a dictionary (do not use built-in set).*

### Create dictionary from lists

* *Write an algorithm that creates a dictionary from two lists: one containing keys and the other containing values.*

### Reverse dictionary

* *Write an algorithm that takes a dictionary and returns a new dictionary with keys and values swapped.*

### Merge dictionaries with sum

* *Write an algorithm that merges two dictionaries. If a key appears in both, sum their values.*

### Find duplicates in list

* *Write an algorithm that finds all duplicate elements in a list using a dictionary.*

### Intersection of arrays

* *Write an algorithm that finds the common elements (intersection) of two arrays using a dictionary for faster lookup.*

### Character index mapping

* *Write an algorithm that maps each character of a string to a list of all its index positions.*

### Count digit frequency

* *Write an algorithm that counts how many times each digit appears in a given integer.*

### Word length mapping

* *Write an algorithm that maps each word in a sentence to its corresponding length using a dictionary.*

### Count vowels

* *Write an algorithm that counts how many times each vowel appears in a given string.*

### Bigram frequency

* *Write an algorithm that returns the frequency of each bigram (pair of consecutive characters) in a string.*

### Check dictionary equality

* *Write an algorithm to check if two dictionaries are equal (i.e., they contain the same key-value pairs).*

### Highest score per student

* *Given a list of student score records in the form of (name, score), write an algorithm to find the highest score for each student and return it as a dictionary.*
